## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence). 
Please follow through this order of notebooks:
- Demographic_initial.ipynb
- EDA_Demographic_GDP.ipynb
- EDA_Demographic_Government.ipynb
- EDA_Demographic_Disaster.ipynb
- Data_Combination.ipynb
- ML_Techniques.ipynb
## Requirements
1. pip install pmdarima (for Demographic_Initial.ipynb)

## Problem Definition
- In the modern world, population growth is influenced by a myriad of factors ranging from economic conditions to environmental events and governmental policies.
- This understanding helps in crafting better-informed economic, environmental, and social policies that proactively manage resources and mitigate risks.
- Checking to see which model is the best at predicting the dependency ratios through factors like gdp.

## Models Used
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regression(RFR)
3. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
4. ARIMA model for demographic prediction (not used in final evaluation)

## Conclusion
- Using the Random Forest (.feature_importances_), we were able to rank the best features for prediction. This can provide us insights on which indicator would potentially affect different demographics.
- Comparable to the other 2 models (Linreg and RFR), GBM has a higher predictive accuracy but is also less robust to outliers, comparing to Random Forest.
- Through the ml techniques we were able to predict the child dependency, elderly dependency ratios and total dependency ratios
- This will help in enabling policy makers to adapt new strategies beforehand through the forecasted data leading to more resilient and sustainable communities

## What did we learn from this project?
1. We learnt new ML techniques such as Gradient Boosting Machine  and Random Forest.
2. We learnt how to incorperate and relate different kinds of data to a specific problem
3. We learnt how to collaborate using github repositories
