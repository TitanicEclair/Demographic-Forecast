## Problem Definition
#### In the modern world, population growth is influenced by a myriad of factors ranging from economic conditions to environmental events and governmental policies. 
#### This understanding helps in crafting better-informed economic, environmental, and social policies that proactively manage resources and mitigate risks.
#### Checking to see which model is the best at predicting the dependency ratios through factors like gdp.

## Models Used

1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regression
3. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)

## What did we learn from this project?
1. We learnt new ML techniques such as Gradient Boosting Machine  and Random Forest.
2. We learnt how to incorperate and relate different kinds of data to a specific problem
3. We learnt how to collaborate using github repositories
